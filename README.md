## Overview
This program downloads a distro image and check the validity and integrity without having to run a bunch of commands from the CLI. 

I thought of creating this program after reading about a hack that occurred on [February 20th, 2016](https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=2994) that resulted in a modified Linux Mint image with a backdoor. A lot of folks either don't have the time to verify the files or they don't know how to. And like the hacker (Peace) involved in this incident said in a [ZDnet article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-hundreds-were-tricked-into-installing-linux-mint-backdoor/): 

> Who the f**k checks those anyway?

With this program, hopefully the answer is you.

## Usage

All you do is run the program with the `-d` flag and the code for a particular distro. The current version supports the following distros:

| Distro | code |
| --- | --- |
| Fedora | fedora |
| Arch Linux | arch |

## Installation

Simple, understandable installation instructions!

```bash
pip install my-package
```

And be sure to specify any other minimum requirements like Python versions or operating systems.

*You may be inclined to add development instructions here, don't.*
